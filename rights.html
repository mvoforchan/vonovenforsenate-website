            <h1>Constitutional Rights & Transparency</h1>
            <p class="issue-summary">Every person deserves due process and civil liberties protected by our Constitution. Government at every level must operate transparently and be held accountable to the people it serves.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="issue-content">
        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>"Constitutional rights aren't negotiable, and they don't depend on where you were born or what you believe. When government oversteps, we have a responsibility to speak up—not because it's politically convenient, but because it's right."</p>
            <cite>— Mark von Oven</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>A Moment That Defines This Campaign</h2>
        
        <p>In 2025, federal ICE agents executed an operation in Chanhassen. With no prior notice to local law enforcement, ICE surrounded two construction workers on a rooftop in sub-zero temperatures, creating a dangerous and volatile situation that could have been avoided. While others remained silent, Mark stood up.</p>

        <p>Mark was the only Chanhassen Councilmember to publicly question the situation. He wasn't making a partisan statement about immigration policy—he was standing up for constitutional principles and the proper role of local government.</p>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>Mark's Position Was Clear and Principled:</h4>
            <ul class="checklist">
                <li>Federal agencies must follow proper legal procedures</li>
                <li>Local governments shouldn't become extensions of federal enforcement without clear legal authority</li>
                <li>Due process and civil liberties belong to everyone, regardless of citizenship status</li>
                <li>Transparency and accountability matter at every level of government</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>This wasn't about whether someone supports stricter or looser immigration enforcement. This was about whether government officials follow the law and respect constitutional boundaries.</p>

        <p><b>The response from the community was overwhelmingly positive from both Republicans and Democrats</b>—not because everyone agreed on immigration policy, but because they recognized a leader willing to stand on principle when it matters most.</p>

        <h2>Why This Matters for State Senate</h2>

        <p>Minnesota needs State Senators who understand that constitutional rights aren't just abstract concepts—they're the foundation of our democracy. When federal or state government oversteps its authority, we need legislators who will defend the proper role of government and protect individual liberties.</p>

        <h3>What Mark Will Fight For in St. Paul</h3>

        <h4>🛡️ Protecting Civil Liberties</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Due Process for Everyone:</strong> Every person in Minnesota deserves fair treatment under the law, regardless of their background or beliefs</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy Rights:</strong> Protection from unreasonable searches and government overreach</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom of Speech and Assembly:</strong> Defending constitutional rights even when opinions are unpopular</li>
            <li><strong>Equal Protection:</strong> Ensuring laws apply equally to everyone</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>📖 Government Transparency</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Open Records:</strong> Making government documents and data accessible to the public</li>
            <li><strong>Public Meetings:</strong> Conducting government business in the open where citizens can participate</li>
            <li><strong>Clear Communication:</strong> Explaining decisions in plain language so everyone can understand</li>
            <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> Holding officials and agencies responsible for their actions</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>⚖️ Proper Role of Government</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federalism:</strong> Respecting the proper division of powers between federal, state, and local government</li>
            <li><strong>Local Control:</strong> Allowing cities and counties to make decisions that reflect their communities' values</li>
            <li><strong>Checks and Balances:</strong> Ensuring no branch or level of government becomes too powerful</li>
            <li><strong>Rule of Law:</strong> Requiring all government officials to follow proper procedures and respect legal boundaries</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Mark's Approach is Different</h2>

        <p>Too many politicians talk about constitutional rights when it's politically convenient but stay silent when it's not. Mark has proven he'll stand up for principles even when it's difficult or controversial.</p>

        <p>His approach is non-partisan: constitutional rights belong to everyone, not just people we agree with. Whether it's protecting free speech we disagree with, ensuring due process for people accused of crimes, or defending privacy rights from government surveillance—Mark believes in consistent principles, not convenient politics.</p>

        <div class="quote-box">
            <p>"Leadership isn't about picking which constitutional rights to defend based on polls or party talking points. It's about standing up for all of them, all the time, for everyone."</p>
            <cite>— Mark von Oven</cite>
        </div>

        <h2>Real-World Impact</h2>

        <h3>On City Council, Mark Has:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Championed open government and transparent decision-making</li>
            <li>Made city data and documents more accessible to residents</li>
            <li>Insisted on clear explanations of city policies and their impacts</li>
            <li>Protected residents' rights in interactions with city government</li>
            <li>Stood up for constitutional principles even when politically risky</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>In the State Senate, Mark Will:</h3>
        <ul class="checklist">
            <li>Oppose legislation that infringes on constitutional rights</li>
            <li>Support transparency measures that open government to public scrutiny</li>
            <li>Defend local control and resist unfunded mandates</li>
            <li>Ensure proper oversight of executive agencies</li>
            <li>Protect civil liberties regardless of partisan pressure</li>
            <li>Stand up for due process and equal protection under the law</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>A Leader for Everyone</h2>

        <p>Constitutional rights and government transparency shouldn't be partisan issues. These principles protect all of us—conservatives and liberals, immigrants and native-born citizens, the powerful and the vulnerable.</p>

        <p>Mark understands that defending these principles sometimes means standing alone, going against political pressure, or taking positions that don't fit neatly into partisan boxes. That's exactly the kind of principled leadership District 48 needs in St. Paul.</p>

        <div class="principle-box">
            <h4>Mark's Commitment to You</h4>
            <p>As your State Senator, I will always defend constitutional principles, even when it's difficult. I will fight for transparent government that serves you, not special interests. And I will stand up for your rights, regardless of political consequences.</p>
            <p>You deserve a Senator who puts principles before politics and people before party. That's what I've done on City Council, and that's what I'll do in St. Paul.</p>
