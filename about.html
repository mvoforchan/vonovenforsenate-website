                    <p class="lead">Mark von Oven brings data-driven decision making, constitutional principles, and a commitment to bringing people together to serve District 48.</p>
                    <p>As a Chanhassen City Councilmember, analytics executive, youth sports coach, and father of three, Mark understands the challenges facing families in our growing communities. He's proven that effective leadership means listening to all voices, making decisions based on facts and common sense, and putting people before politics.</p>
                    <p>Mark's leadership style is straightforward: gather the data, listen to the community, find common ground, and deliver results that make our neighborhoods better places to live, work, and raise families.</p>

                        <h3>Family Roots & Values</h3>
                        <p>Mark's father, Ronald von Oven, immigrated to the United States from the Netherlands, bringing with him a deep appreciation for hard work and the responsibility of every American to protect and defend our Democracy. Ron's journey instilled in Mark a profound respect for constitutional rights, the rule of law, and the importance of protecting civil liberties for everyone.</p>
                        <p>Growing up in a family that valued both individual freedom and community responsibility shaped Mark's approach to public service: listen to everyone, respect different viewpoints, and work to find solutions that strengthen the entire community.</p>

                        <h3>Life in Chanhassen</h3>
                        <p>Mark and his wife Jaclyn are raising their three children in Chanhassen: Charlize, and twin boys Ashton and Braden. Like many families in District 48, they're juggling work, school activities, youth sports, and the everyday challenges of raising kids in a growing suburban community.</p>
                        <p>Mark coaches youth sports and has been deeply involved in the Lotus Lake Conservation Alliance, understanding firsthand the importance of strong schools, safe neighborhoods, clean lakes, and opportunities for families to thrive.</p>

                        <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
                        <p>As an Analytics Executive, Mark has spent his career turning complex data into actionable insights and leading teams to solve difficult problems. This analytical approach—gathering facts, identifying what works, and making evidence-based decisions—is exactly what he brings to public service.</p>
                        <p>Mark's professional background means he knows how to:</p>

                        <h3>Public Service</h3>
                        <h4>Chanhassen City Council (2023-Present)</h4>
                        <p>In his first term on the City Council, Mark has focused on fiscal responsibility, transparent government, and smart growth that preserves what makes Chanhassen special while preparing for the future.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Key Accomplishments:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="checklist">
                            <li><strong>New City Hall & Civic Campus:</strong> Led the development of modern municipal facilities that serve residents efficiently and responsibly</li>
                            <li><strong>New Community Center:</strong> Brought new recreational opportunities and community gathering spaces to Chanhassen families</li>
                            <li><strong>Fiscal Responsibility:</strong> Maintained fiscal discipline while making strategic investments in community priorities</li>
                            <li><strong>Transparent Governance:</strong> Championed open government and accountability at every level</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Chanhassen Planning Commission</h4>
                        <p>Before joining the City Council, Mark served on the Planning Commission, where he learned the detailed work of land use planning, development review, and balancing growth with community character.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bio-block">
                        <h3>Standing Up for Constitutional Principles</h3>
                        <p>In 2025, federal ICE agents executed an operation in Chanhassen. With no prior notice to local law enforcement, ICE surrounded two construction workers on a rooftop in sub-zero temperatures, creating a dangerous and volatile situation that could have been avoided. While others remained silent, Mark stood up.</p>
                        <p>He wasn't making a partisan statement—he was defending constitutional principles and the proper role of local government. Mark believes that federal agencies must follow the law, that local governments shouldn't become extensions of federal enforcement without clear legal authority, and that transparency and accountability matter at every level of government.</p>
                        <p>This moment revealed Mark's character: when faced with a difficult situation, he stood on principle, spoke clearly about constitutional rights, and demonstrated the kind of leadership District 48 needs in St. Paul. (See video in sidebar)</p>
                        <p>The response from the community was overwhelmingly positive—not because people agreed on every aspect of immigration policy, but because they recognized a leader willing to stand up for the rule of law and constitutional governance.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="bio-block">
                        <h3>Why Mark is Running</h3>
                        <p>District 48 deserves a State Senator who:</p>
                        <ul class="checklist">
                            <li>Brings people together instead of driving them apart</li>
                            <li>Makes decisions based on data and common sense, not ideology</li>
                            <li>Protects constitutional rights for everyone</li>
                            <li>Focuses on solving real problems facing families</li>
                            <li>Keeps government accountable and transparent</li>
                            <li>Delivers results, not just rhetoric</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Mark has proven on the City Council that this approach works. Now he's ready to bring that same practical, principled leadership to the Minnesota State Senate.</p>
